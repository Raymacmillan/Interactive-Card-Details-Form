## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn't about regular expressions.I realised that i made a lot of mistakes with my HTML as i did not take a closer look to all the designs of my task so in my next project i will make sure to firstly assess every design to have a clear picture of the foundation(HTML) and plan ahead in time


**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I realised that i still have a weakness in Javascript and i would like to continue working on many projects inorder to improve and sharpen my programming problem solving skills
